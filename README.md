This project was created using HTML/CSS/JS with the Bootstrap 4 framework and chart.js library for the graphs. This project was intended to develop my skills in creating a responsive web page and visualizing data.

The data was collected from swimmingrankings.net. Not all the times for each athlete were included in the tables as the data was hardcoded into them. As a result, the results from the graphs are subject to be skewed. Moreover, future steps that could taken with this project is to implement SQL to store the data properly and use a web scraper to collect ALL the data rather than have myself hardcode it into the tables.

All in all, this was a great opportunity for my to develop an understanding for responsive styling as well as data visualization.

# Notes

Start with the home.html page.

I calculated the athletes' optimal strokes by taking the largest average FINA points of each stroke's events. Similarily, the athletes' best events were determined through choosing the event with the most FINA points.
